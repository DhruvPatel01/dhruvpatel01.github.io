<p>The talks given at Myntra starts with an introduction to Bayesian Linear Regression. I explain analytic solution and also introduce PyMC3 based solution. Then I proceed to explain Markov Chains that were used by PyMC internally. In the process Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs chain were explained. The notebook is available <a href="https://github.com/DhruvPatel01/myntra_talks/blob/master/bayesian_intro_with_pymc.ipynb">here</a>. For proofs there is <a href="https://github.com/DhruvPatel01/myntra_talks/blob/master/mcmc.pdf">supplementary pdf</a>.</p>
<h2 id="on-double-precision-floating-points">On Double precision floating points<a href="#on-double-precision-floating-points" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In this talk, I introduced subtleties of using floating points to the audience. Talk starts with classic mistake done in Patriot Missile system, which caused life of 28 soldiers. Then I introduce naive/intuitive algorithm of computing variance online (in one pass), and dangers of it. While explaining what caused the issues in naive algorithm, I explain how different programming languages might give different results while working with floats. I then explain the Achilles' heel of floating point calculation called catastrophic calculation, and how to avoid it. Talks concludes with Welford&rsquo;s algorithm on computing variance online. Slides are available <a href="/slides/floats.slides.html">here</a>.</p>
